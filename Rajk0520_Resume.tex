\section*{Projects :}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\Large \textbf{Mocking Bot}}{ \hfill {\bf eYRC-2018, IIT Bombay}}\\
{\bf Audio Processing, Embedded System, Sensor Interfacing.} \hfill{\bf Nov 2018-Mar} \\ \hfill {\bf 2019}\\
To a given audio file apply audio processing. Extract the notes, onset, instrument from the audio. Communicate the information to the bot which will imitate the same music on piano and trumpet made for the same.
\item {\Large \textbf{Portable Braille}}{ \hfill {\bf Sangam'18, Pragyan, NIT Trichy}}\\
{\bf Embedded Systems, Image Processing, Circuit Design.}\hfill{\bf Dec 2018 - Mar} \\ \hfill {\bf 2019}\\
This project is an approach to solve the problem of unavailability of many of the books and texts in Braille scripts. In short, it is an assistive reading technology: Portable Braille, a system which is able to translate the captured image of a printed material into Braille code and reproduce them in the braille terminal.\\
\item {\Large \textbf{Wireless Gesture Controlled Game Controller }}\\
{\bf Embedded Systems, IR Communication, Sensor Interfacing.} \hfill {\bf Aug 2018-Sept}\\ \hfill {\bf 2018}\\
A wireless gesture recognition setup which is used in place of keyboard to play various games. This setup includes IR Communication (NEC Protocol), microcontroller etc.
